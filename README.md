📊 Data Analytics Bootcamp – Python Projects
Welcome to my Python Bootcamp for Data Analytics repository!
This space documents my learning journey as a BCA student at the Institute of Innovation in Technology and Management (IITM) under the mentorship of Mr. Divyank Chauhan.

I created this repository to showcase the projects, exercises, and concepts I’ve explored throughout the bootcamp.

🚀 Objective
To strengthen my Python programming skills and build a strong foundation for a career in Data Analytics.
This repository includes hands-on tasks and beginner-to-intermediate level projects written in Python.

🧠 What I've Learned So Far
Python basics (syntax, variables, data types)

Control flow (if-else, loops)

Functions & modular programming

Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)

File handling and exception management

Logic building and real-world applications
